# Regular Expressions (REGEX)

## What is a Regular Expression?
Regular expressions, often shortened to regex, are a search pattern used to match and manipulate text. Think of it like a template or pattern that we use to search for certain words or combinations of characters in a string. Regex is very useful for various tasks like data validation, text parsing, text search and replace, and much more.
